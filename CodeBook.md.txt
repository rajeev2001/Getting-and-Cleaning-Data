# Study Design

Source data for this project was Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.The data linked to 
from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# About R script

R script *run_analysis.R* is used to clean, summarize and prepare tidy data set *secondarytidy.txt*
Kindly refer **README.md** file for details. 

1.Download and unzip the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2.Load the activity and feature info
3.Loads training and test datasets extracting only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
4.Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
5.merge training and test datasets to create one data set and add labels
5.Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
7.Calculate average of each variable for each activity and each subject and prepare secondary tidy dataset 
8.Write output of tidy data set  in the file secondarytidy.txt

# Code Book

This code book provides summary about dataset in *secondarytidy.txt*

## Identifiers

* subject - The ID of the test subject
